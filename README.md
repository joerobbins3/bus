# Bus Project

This project demonstrates my ability to use asynchronous code, in this case to fetch data from a 3rd party API, and then update how that data is displayed in real-time. 

## To Run: 

Download source files from repository to root folder, and then open [Index](https://github.com/joerobbins3/bus/blob/main/index.html) in browser. Map will render on screen with bus stop markers and bus location indicators. Bus Location indicators will update every 15 seconds onload. 

## Future Improvements: 

I would love to implement of logging mechanism that tracks variance of historical route times, this would enable the user to see which buses, drivers and routes are typically the fastest, what may cause slowdowns, etc.
